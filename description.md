### State of the Map US 2018: OSM Data Analysis Workshop

**Purpose**: OSM data analysis can be an overwhelming and daunting task for a multitude of reasons. First, the data is _big_. While the definition of what consitutes as "big data" is often contested, a database with a planet's worth of geospatial data is not a small dataset. 

The data is self-referential. As simple as the OSM data model aims to be, it becomes complicated out of it's primary context. Designed to work in a relational database, OSM objects require nontrivial reconstruction steps to exist on their own outside of this
